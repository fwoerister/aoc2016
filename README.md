# 🎄 Advent of Code 2016

This repository contains my C++ solutions for the [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016) programming puzzles.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Compile All Solutions

```sh
make all
```

### 🔨 Compile a Specific Day

```sh
make day01
```

### ▶️ Run a Solution

- Make sure the corresponding input file is located in the `./input` folder (e.g., `./input/day01.txt`).

- Run the compiled executable from the `./build` folder:

```sh
./build/day01
```
